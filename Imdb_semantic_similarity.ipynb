The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal   I couldn't say I was ready for it   but as I watched more   I developed a taste for Oz   and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence   but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel   inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it   well mannered   middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz    0.0\n",

You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries                           not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which   rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears.

This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way                                                                                                                                                 or another to the next person                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but no one seems to know the previous point of contact.

We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment   as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction.

I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies  the life of the student's mom)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people                                                                                                                                                                                                                        the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God.
